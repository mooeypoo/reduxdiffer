# reduxdiffer
[EXPERIMENTAL] A tool that allows browser-based widgets (ooui for the demo) to listen to redux state changes

## To use:

* Clone the repo
* Run 'npm install'
* Load the demo.html in the browser

Note that if there are any changes made to anything in the `src/redux` folder, or the Controller, `ReduxStoreDiffer` and `recursiveDiffer`, you must run `grunt` again to rebuild the es6 elements.
